Compilation instructions

Since my solution is based on Python there is no need for compiling it. You
can call it directly using the Python interpreter as
    
    python program.py <training-set> <validation-set> <test-set> <to-print>

Also, you can run the program directly using the bash script:

    ./program <training-set> <validation-set> <test-set> <to-print>
